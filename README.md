# Go-crypto

My work at incognito chain requires me to read lots of papers about Cryptography. To understand those thoroughly, I decided to code those algorithm for educational purposes.

If you'd like to use these code, feel free to do it. However, use it with your own risk.

If anyone find a bug, notify me through Issues.
